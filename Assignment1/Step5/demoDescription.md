We need a name for this.
========================

Many bicyclists use a bike computer, and a phone-based fitness app to track different aspects of their rides. But why are these items distinct and disconnected? The standard bike computer uses a sensor on the front wheel to get an extremely precise, high-resolution speed measurement. Many (if not all) fitness apps currently depend on location-based input for determining common measurements such as speed and distance. Cellular polling can be very energy-intensive, and many app designers have thus sacrificed precision for battery life. This system would provide more precise information, with significantly less energy. We seek to make a hardware device that communicates with smartphones using Bluetooth, in a manner useful to many new or existing apps. 

##Features to potentially explore:##
- Obtain power from bike motion -- eliminates inconvenience (and weight) of batteries. 
- Allow device to communicate directly to internet, without a phone (using GPRS or something like that). 
-- Could allow for monitoring a stolen bicycle 
- Integrate other sensors, such as temperature, that can impact the quality and health benefits of the ride. 
- Detect significant crashes and automatically call for help
